### Integrating Effect into Next.js ecosystem as part of Contract-based programming and Error-Driven Development (work in progress)

So far, improvements are visible in the following processes:

- enhanced error handling for asynchronous operations
- better testing and mocking capabilities
- simplified state and side-effect management
- composability for reusable logic
- efficient resource management
- reduced boilerplate for common patterns

For disadvantages:

- steeper learning curve
- immature ecosystem
- limited tooling and debugging support
- potential for vendor lock-in

Future hypotheses to prove or disprove:

- type-safe data fetching and API interactions
- streamlined server-side rendering
- improved concurrency for parallel tasks
- potential performance overhead
- risk of over-engineering
